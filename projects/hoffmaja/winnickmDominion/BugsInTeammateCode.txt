* BUGS IN TEAMMATE CODE *

-- Smithy draws too many cards --

One bug revealed by my tests is that my partner’s *smithyEffect function draws too many cards.
Smithy should add three cards to the player’s deck, however, the function is drawing four.
This bug was likely introduced per the Assignment 2 instructions, as it doesn’t exist in the
original code.

The bug can be seen on line 1,257 in *dominion.c.



In a running program, this bug would cause considerable disruption to the game, as
every Smithy that’s played would either result in an unfair advantage or disadvantage
to its player, depending on the cards drawn.

To reproduce the error in a test environment, simply add Smithy to a player’s hand
and call the *smithyEffect function. The deck can be examined before and after function
call, revealing that too many cards have been added.



-- Adventurer doesn’t discard itself --

Playing the Adventurer card using the *adventurerEffect function should cause the card
to be removed from the player’s hand. This was made evident by inspecting the player’s
hand printed onscreen, however, not part of my original test, as I had updated the function
in my own code for Assignment 2. The test now shows a failed assertion when Adventurer
remains in the player’s hand after being played.

The *adventurerEffect function ends on line 1,250 in *dominion.c, where the error is evident
by comparing the function to the other refactored card functions. While the others discard
the played card as a final action, *discardCard is missing from the end of *adventurerEffect.

A reproduction of the error can be accomplished by adding Adventurer to a player’s hand and
playing the card. Examining the player’s hand after calling *adventurerEffect will reveal
that the card has not been discarded.
